# AmazonSelenium
Selenium Java testing for the Amazon lightning deals page, the test gets the credentials from the excel file in the Driver folder, it then goes to the Amazon website, logs in, goes to the promotions page, filters by lightning deals, and collects all the item names in an Extent Reports document.
